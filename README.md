# Buutti Assignment challenge

## Task:

  Implement a simple single-page web application which manages a collection of books. The
  web application should have a UI consisting of a single HTML web page, and a simple
  backend. The backend provides a REST API with which the UI communicates. We want the
  application to have the following features:

    1. When the web page is loaded, it fetches all the books to a list. The title and the
        author of each book are displayed in the list.
    2. When a book in the list is clicked, it is selected and its author, title and description are
        displayed in a form next to the list.
    3. By inputting data to the form and pressing a button labelled “save new”, the user can
        add new books to the collection.
    4. By editing the form data of an existing book and pressing a button labelled “save”,
        the user can update the data of the book in the collection.
    5. There is also a delete button that can be used to delete a selected book from the
        collection.
    6. All the changes that user has made to the collection must be preserved on a page
        reload.
    7. The application (front and backend) can be started with a single command in terminal
